						Hi! My name is Dylan Stevens.
						<br/><br/>
					</h1>
					<h1 className="text-justify text-lg font-semibold text-default-500">
						I have been working in the technology field for 2 years. I am currently obtaining a degree (B.Sc, Computer Science) from the University of Victoria. I&apos;ve previously worked as a front end web application developer for an 8-month co-op contract with the BC Pension Corporation, and as a front end voice-app python developer for L1 Scientific LTD (see more in <Link underline="hover" href="/resume" size="lg" color={"primary"}>resum√©</Link> section).
						<br/><br/>
						Living in British Columbia, I&apos;m currently based in the pacific northwest area, and hope to contribute to the growing technology on the west coast of the US and Canada. 
						<br/><br/>
						I&apos;m particularly interested in software development that focuses on designing and programming software for embedded systems, and other specialized computing devices within larger systems or products. I have work experience developing for specialized computing devices, cloud computing, and web development. 
						<br/><br/>
						Outside of the work force, I&apos;m passionate about skiing, biking, and many other outdoor recreations.
						<br/><br/>
						Thank you for visiting my website and reading about me. Please feel free to send me an email (dylan@dylanstevens.ca) to reach out, and check out my resume for a record of my skills and employment history.
